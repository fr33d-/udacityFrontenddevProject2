# Udacity frontend developer project Nr. 2

Its a simple memory game.

The animations work best in Google Chrome.

Flip the cards and hope for the best, its like every memory game you've seen. If the cards match they will stay open and you got them, if not go for another try.

A indicator tells you how many items you found, how good you are and how much time you spend with the game. If you like it, tell others about it.

### Opening the game:
You can run it from the index.html or as a developer runt the development server:
1: run '> npm install'
2: start the liveserver with '> gulp'

### To the reviewer:
1. I really disagree with the rule that it doesn't count as a move when you click twice on a card. It is now implemented like this but still i disagree.
When you click on a card you can see what symbol it has. If you hide it again and your moves don't count up, you still know what is under the card.
So you could easily cheat on the game.
2. I can not reproduce the but with the stars, they work well here. Till 20 stars you got 3, till 30 2 and over 40 0 stars. Please tell me more about it if its not working for you.
