# Udacity frontend developer project Nr. 2

Its a simple memory game. 

The animations work best in Google Chrome.

Flip the cards and hope for the best, its like every memory game you've seen. If the cards match they will stay open and you got them, if not go for another try. 

A indicator tells you how many items you found, how good you are and how much time you spend with the game. If you like it, tell others about it. 

### Opening the game:
You can run it from the index.html or as a developer runt the development server:
1: run '> npm install'
2: start the liveserver with '> gulp'
